# Verification

## Goal

When a property fails, determine whether the failure represents a real bug
in the SUT or a problem in the harness. A property failure is a candidate,
not a conclusion.

## Reading the Counterexample

Whether from local output or Antithesis triage:

1. **Identify the sequence of events** leading to the failure. What operations
   happened? What state was the system in? What faults were active?
2. **Identify the assertion that failed.** Which specific assertion? What were
   the values at the moment of failure?
3. **Compare to the feature's properties.** Does the observed sequence
   represent a genuine violation of the property? Is the invariant actually
   broken, or did the assertion check the wrong thing?

For Antithesis runs, use `antithesis-triage` to get the failure details. If
the triage output isn't enough to understand the mechanism, use
`antithesis-debug` to inspect container state at the failure moment — the
Multiverse Debugger lets you time-travel through the sequence and inspect
state at any point.

## Classifying the Finding

### Real bug in SUT

The assertion correctly detected a violation of a feature property. Evidence:

- The sequence of events demonstrates the bug's mechanism — you can explain
  step by step how the system arrived at the incorrect state
- The failure is reproducible (locally, in Antithesis, or both)
- No harness, assertion, or workload bug explains the observation

Any real bug found while testing a feature is valuable. Record it and decide
with the user whether to fix it now or continue testing other properties.

### Assertion bug

The assertion itself is wrong or too strict. Evidence:

- The SUT behavior is actually correct given the inputs and conditions
- The assertion doesn't account for a valid edge case, a transient state,
  or a legitimate execution order
- The assertion fails on correct behavior, not on a bug

Common assertion bugs:

- **Too strict on timing.** The assertion checks a condition that's transiently
  false during normal operation (e.g., checking consistency during an in-flight
  update).
- **Wrong bound.** The assertion uses exact equality instead of bounded
  assertions. Under fault injection, unacknowledged operations may have
  succeeded.
- **Missing precondition.** The assertion checks a condition that only makes
  sense after specific setup, but the workload sometimes evaluates it before
  setup completes.
- **Stale state.** The assertion reads state that hasn't propagated yet and
  treats the stale value as incorrect.

Fix the assertion and continue testing.

### Workload bug

The workload created an invalid scenario. Evidence:

- The workload sent malformed input, violated a protocol, or misused an API
- The SUT's response to the invalid input is correct (or at least not a
  property violation)
- The assertion failure is a consequence of the workload's mistake, not a
  SUT defect

Common workload bugs:

- **Violating idempotency contracts.** Retrying an operation the SUT doesn't
  promise is idempotent, then asserting on the unexpected result.
- **Race in the workload.** The workload's own concurrency creates an invalid
  state in its tracking data, causing a false assertion.
- **Wrong operation sequence.** The workload calls APIs in an order the SUT
  doesn't support and treats the error as a bug.
- **Incorrect bounds tracking.** The workload miscounts attempts or
  acknowledgments, producing wrong bounds that the SUT correctly violates.

Fix the workload and continue testing.

### Environment issue

Infrastructure or configuration problem. Evidence:

- The failure is caused by a misconfigured container, missing dependency,
  incorrect network setup, or resource exhaustion in the test environment
- The SUT never entered the state the assertion checks because the
  environment prevented it from running normally

Common environment issues:

- **Containers can't reach each other.** Network misconfiguration, DNS
  resolution failure, wrong IP addresses.
- **Container crash loops.** OOM, missing config files, broken entrypoints.
- **Missing SDK setup.** `ANTITHESIS_OUTPUT_DIR` not set, SDK not initialized,
  assertion catalog not linked.
- **Resource exhaustion.** Disk full, port conflicts, connection limits.

Fix the environment and continue testing.

## Verification Questions

For any finding, ask:

1. **Can I explain the mechanism step by step?** If not, dig deeper — use
   `antithesis-debug` for Antithesis runs, add logging for local runs.
2. **Is the SUT actually wrong?** The sequence shows what happened; that's
   not the same as wrong. The SUT may have correctly handled an unusual but
   valid scenario.
3. **Could the workload have caused this?** Check whether the workload's
   own behavior (retries, concurrent access, operation ordering) created the
   conditions rather than the SUT's logic.

## Documenting Findings

When a finding is verified, record it in
`antithesis/feature-workloads/<feature-slug>/analysis.md`:

- **Sequence**: The step-by-step sequence of events that led to the finding —
  what operations, what state, what timing or faults.
- **Detection**: Which assertion detected it and what the values were at
  failure.
- **Mechanism**: How the system arrives at the incorrect state — the root
  cause, not just the symptoms.
- **Counterexample details**: For Antithesis runs: run ID, moment, containers
  involved. For local runs: log output, timestamps.
- **Classification**: Real SUT bug, assertion bug, workload bug, or
  environment issue — and the evidence for the classification.
