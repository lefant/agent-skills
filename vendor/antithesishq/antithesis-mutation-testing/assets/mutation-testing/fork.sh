# Materialize an ephemeral copy of the source tree for mutation testing.
#
# INTENT
#   Produce a throwaway git repo mirroring --source, tagged `mutation-base`,
#   carrying one `mut/<id>` branch per patch in --patches.
#
# ASSUMES
#   - git and rsync are on PATH.
#   - --source is a directory; --fork is outside it; --patches is outside --fork.
#   - --fork is either absent, empty, or a fork of this same --source.
#   - Each --patches/<id>.patch is a diff against mutation-base.
#
# GUARANTEES
#   - --source is never written to.
#   - The fork exists, carries .git/antithesis-mutation-fork, and has a
#     `mutation-base` tag whose tree depends only on the source's contents.
#   - Gitignored files are committed, so a mutant may touch them.
#   - Exits non-zero rather than discarding a `mut/*` branch that has no patch,
#     or one revised beyond its exported patch.
#
# The copy excludes .git and gets a fresh `git init`, so every git command the
# harness runs is confined to the fork. Nothing here can reach the user's real
# repository, whatever shape it is in (worktree, submodule, or not git at all).
set -euo pipefail

# `git -C DIR` only changes directory: GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE and friends take
# precedence over repository discovery, so inheriting them points every git
# command below at whatever repo the caller was in. Hooks export
# GIT_INDEX_FILE and `git submodule foreach` exports GIT_DIR, so this is
# reachable from an ordinary invocation, and it defeats the entire fork model.

# Inside .git deliberately. The work tree is what `git add -A -f` sweeps into a
# commit and what `git clean -x` deletes, so a marker living there gets
# committed into every mutant patch and removed by a reset. .git is neither
# copied by rsync nor reachable from the index.

Usage: fork.sh --source DIR --patches DIR --fork DIR
               [--exclude PATTERN]... [--no-apply] [--force]

  --source    Root of the source tree to copy.
  --patches   Directory of <mutant-id>.patch files. Need not exist yet.
  --fork      Where the fork goes. Must be outside --source. An existing
              directory is reused only if a previous fork.sh created it.
  --exclude   Extra rsync exclude pattern; repeatable. An unanchored pattern
              matches at any depth; a leading / anchors it to the root of
              --source. For large build directories the image does not need,
              and for a scratchbook somewhere other than antithesis/scratchbook.
  --no-apply  Leave the fork at mutation-base without replaying existing patches.
  --force     Re-fork even though mut/* branches would be lost (see sync-patches.sh).

The patch directory and antithesis/scratchbook are excluded automatically when
they sit inside --source. Both are written to during a sweep and neither is
built, so copying them in would move base_tree and invalidate the baseline.

Each run re-creates the fork from scratch. Un-exported branches are destroyed by
that, which is what --force overrides. STALE patches are reported on stderr; the
exit status stays 0, so check the output rather than just the status.

Copies the source tree (excluding .git), runs `git init` in the copy, commits it
as the tag `mutation-base`, and replays <patches>/*.patch onto one `mut/<id>`
branch each. Leaves the fork checked out at mutation-base. Prints the fork path
and the base_tree fingerprint.
