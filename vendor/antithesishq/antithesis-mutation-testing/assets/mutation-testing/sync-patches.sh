# Regenerate the patch directory from the fork's mut/* branches.
#
# INTENT
#   Make --patches match the fork's mut/* branch tips, so a re-fork replays the
#   mutants as they are now rather than as they were exported.
#
# ASSUMES
#   - --fork was made by fork.sh and has at least one mut/* branch.
#   - Each branch is named mut/<mutant-id> and is committed; uncommitted work
#     is not exported.
#
# GUARANTEES
#   - The old patch set is never removed before the new one is written.
#   - Refuses to shrink the set without --force.
#
# Each patch is a diff against mutation-base, so every patch applies
# independently. Mutants are siblings, never a stack.

# GIT_INDEX_FILE and `git submodule foreach` exports GIT_DIR, so this is
# reachable from an ordinary invocation, and it defeats the entire fork model.

  --fork      The fork holding the mut/* branches to export.
  --patches   Directory the patches are written to. Created if absent.
  --force     Allow the patch count to shrink (a mutant was retired).
