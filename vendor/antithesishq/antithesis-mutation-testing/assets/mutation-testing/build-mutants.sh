# Build the baseline and one image set per mutant, each under its own tag.
#
# INTENT
#   Leave one locally-built image set per mutant, tagged mut-<id>, plus the
#   baseline, so a launch can select any of them without rebuilding.
#
# ASSUMES
#   - --fork was made by fork.sh, and select-mutant.sh sits beside this script.
#   - A Compose v2 front-end is on PATH; `docker-compose` is the one snouty
#     itself execs.
#   - --images is non-empty and every entry is retaggable (see select-mutant.sh).
#
# GUARANTEES
#   - Every build runs in its own compose project, never the user's.
#   - The fork is left on the baseline.
#   - Exits non-zero, naming them, if any mutant failed to build.
#
# Does not push: snouty pushes the images the compose references at launch.

Usage: build-mutants.sh --fork DIR --patches DIR --images FILE
                        [--config REL] [--only ID[,ID...]] [--no-baseline]

  --fork      The fork to build from.
  --patches   Directory of <mutant-id>.patch files; the patch set is the mutant list.
  --images    File listing the image names to retag, one per line.
  --config    Compose directory, relative to the fork (default: antithesis/config).
  --only      Build just these mutant ids.
  --no-baseline  Skip the baseline build.

Builds the baseline from mutation-base, then one image set per patch, tagging
each `baseline` or `mut-<id>`. A mutant whose patch no longer applies is
reported and skipped; the rest still build. Slow: run it in the background or
with a generous timeout.
