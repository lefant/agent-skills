# Prove a built mutant image actually carries its patch, before a run is spent.
#
# INTENT
#   Exit 0 only when this mutant's announcement is observed in the running
#   containers, so an unpatched build cannot reach a launch.
#
# ASSUMES
#   - The image for <mutant-id> has already been built by build-mutants.sh.
#   - snouty and a Compose v2 front-end are on PATH.
#   - The mutant's patch carries a startup announcement reading
#     `ANTITHESIS MUTANT ACTIVE: <mutant-id>` and emits it before setup_complete.
#
# GUARANTEES
#   - The stack comes up in its own compose project and is torn down either way.
#   - A failed or empty log read is reported as unverified, never as a pass.
#
# This is the one check between a silently-unpatched build and a survivor that
# gets misread as a catalog gap.

Usage: verify-mutant.sh <mutant-id> --fork DIR --patches DIR --images FILE
                        [--config REL] [--timeout SECS]

  --fork      The fork to bring up.
  --patches   Directory of <mutant-id>.patch files.
  --images    File listing the image names to retag, one per line.
  --config    Compose directory, relative to the fork (default: antithesis/config).
  --timeout   Passed to `snouty validate`, whose own default is 60s. Derive it
              from the baseline's observed setup time: a SUT with migrations or
              a multi-node cluster exceeds 60s for reasons that have nothing to
              do with the mutant.

Selects the mutant, runs `snouty validate --keep-running`, greps the container
logs for `ANTITHESIS MUTANT ACTIVE: <mutant-id>`, and tears the containers down.
Exits non-zero if the announcement is absent -- do not launch that mutant.
